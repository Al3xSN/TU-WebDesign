					<h2>Become a Copywriter</h2>
					<img src="./resources/copywriting-img.jpg" alt="" />
					<p>
						Copywriting is the art and science of strategically delivering
						words (whether written or spoken) that get people to take some
						form of action. It can range from anything to sales pages, to
						email marketing, to even quality blog content. If you have a
						natural inclination and passion for writing, copywriting may be
						your ticket to earning online income. It’s a great way to achieve
						freedom in your life. Not only does copywriting allow you to work
						remotely, but it also allows you to control your schedule.

					<h2>App Development</h2>
					<img src="./resources/developer-img.jpg" alt="" />
					<p>
						Mobile apps are getting more and more popular by the year. If you
						have an idea for a cool, useful, and/or fun app for a phone or a
						tablet, this may be the way to go. It helps to have some coding
						knowledge, but it’s not an absolute necessity. There are plenty of
						software developers looking to collaborate with people on app
						creation. Word of caution: the app market is saturated right now,
						so make sure you validate your app and do your research before
						investing lots of money in your idea.

						commission by promoting somebody else’s product. There are two
						main ways most people do affiliate marketing: Information
						products. You promote products like ebooks, membership sites,
						video series, etc. This type of affiliate marketing can earn you
						up to 50% or more in commission, has relatively low barriers to
						entry, and it’s easy to find products to promote. Amazon partners.
						Many affiliate marketers have success with Amazon. There are
						literally millions of products to choose from, and it can be quite
						profitable. For more information, you can check out the
